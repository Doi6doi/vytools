# VyTools

**VyTools** is a *C* and *C++* library which makes often used tasks easier.

The [C library](c) contains some fixed-size basic types, often used structures,
basic string and stream handling and a resizable buffer.

The [C++ library](cpp) defines the namespace *vyt*. It contains the same
basic types with *C++*-style naming, some utility functions, basic types
for non-create, non-assign, referent-counted or copy-on-write classes, exception,
a basic stream and a char- and wide string.
