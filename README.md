# VyTools

**VyTools** is a *C* and *C++* library which
makes often used tasks easier.

The [C library](https://doi6doi.github.io/vytools/C.html) contains some fixed-size basic types,
often used structures, basic string and stream handling
and a resizable buffer.

The [C++ library](https://doi6doi.github.io/vytools/Cpp.html) defines the namespace *vyt*.
It contains the same basic types with *C++*-style naming,
some utility functions, basic types for non-create,
non-assign, referent-counted or copy-on-write classes,
exception, a basic stream and a char- and wide string.
